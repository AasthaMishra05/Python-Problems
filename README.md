# Python-Problems
This repository contains Basic Python coding problems (and solutions).
The problems are borrowed from the Internet and the solutions are given in Jupyter notebooks with detailed comments to help understand them. The proposed solutions are not necessarily optimal so feel free to to contact me if you find anything wrong with them. 

For example:

Reverse the String

Roots of a quadratic equation

Simple Intrest

Smallest of an array

Vowel or consonant etc..
